       <p>Wow… can you believe it’s already been a month? Feels like yesterday we just met online, yet it already feels like I’ve known you forever. Honestly, these past few weeks have been full of laughs, smiles, and, of course, your classic ragebaiting me moments, I swear, you’ve perfected the art of making me mad… and then making me laugh right after. 😅
I love how jolly you are, how your laughter is contagious even through a screen, and how you somehow manage to make me feel reassured no matter the distance between us.</p><br>
        <p>You’ve made this online connection feel so real, and I can’t wait for the day we finally get to meet in person.
Thank you for making me smile, for teasing me endlessly, and for just being you. Here’s to our first monthsary, may it be the first of many more to come, filled with laughter, love, and maybe a little more ragebaiting. 😉
<br>Miss you and can’t wait until we finally see each other!💖</p>
